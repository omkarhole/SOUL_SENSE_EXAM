Test script for Poison-Resistant Lock - Prevents Mutex Poisoning on Panic #1188

Tests the poison-resistant lock implementation to ensure:
- Locks are automatically released when threads panic/crash
- No cascading deadlocks from poisoned mutexes
- Lock recovery works correctly
- Thread death is handled gracefully
