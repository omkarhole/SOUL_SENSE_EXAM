class OutboxRelayService:
    """
    Relay Service for the Transactional Outbox Pattern (#1176).

    Guarantees At-Least-Once delivery of search indexing events to Elasticsearch.
    Implements exponential backoff for failed delivery attempts.

    Idempotency contract:
      - Each outbox event payload carries a stable `event_id` (UUID).
      - Elasticsearch writes use doc_id-level upsert/delete which are inherently
        idempotent: re-sending the same event_id causes an overwrite with the
        same data, not a duplicate.
      - The relay fetches the LATEST journal state at relay-time (not at write-time),
        so stale payloads are automatically corrected (e.g., soft-delete race).
